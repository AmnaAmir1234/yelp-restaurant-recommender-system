1. Open the generated HTML file in your browser
2. Enter a user ID or use demo data
3. Select recommendation algorithm type
4. Specify number of recommendations needed
5. View personalized results and insights

### API Usage Example
```python
# Initialize models
cf_model = CollaborativeFiltering(processed_data)
cb_model = ContentBasedFiltering(processed_data)
ca_model = ContextAwareFiltering(processed_data)

# Train models
cf_model.create_user_item_matrix()
cf_model.calculate_user_similarity()
cb_model.create_business_profiles()

# Get recommendations
user_recommendations = cf_model.get_recommendations('user_123', n_recommendations=10)
content_recommendations = cb_model.get_recommendations('user_123', n_recommendations=10)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Data Pipeline
1. **Data Loading** - Import and validate Yelp dataset
2. **Preprocessing** - Clean, filter, and feature engineering
3. **Model Training** - Initialize and train all recommendation algorithms
4. **Evaluation** - Performance assessment using train/test split
5. **Recommendation Generation** - Real-time prediction and ranking

### Algorithm Implementation

#### Collaborative Filtering
- Creates user-item interaction matrices
- Computes similarity matrices using cosine similarity
- Generates predictions through weighted neighborhood approaches

#### Content-Based Filtering
- Builds TF-IDF vectors from review text
- Creates business and user profiles
- Matches preferences through content similarity

#### Context-Aware Filtering
- Incorporates temporal patterns and trends
- Analyzes user activity levels and business popularity
- Adjusts recommendations based on contextual factors

#### Hybrid System
- Combines predictions from all algorithms
- Uses weighted averaging for optimal performance
- Balances different recommendation strengths

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates performance using:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** - Prediction accuracy
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** - Average prediction deviation
- **Precision@K** - Relevant recommendations in top K results
- **Recall@K** - Coverage of relevant items in recommendations

### Typical Performance Results
- Hybrid Model: RMSE ~0.89, MAE ~0.72
- Content-Based: RMSE ~0.94, MAE ~0.78
- Collaborative: RMSE ~0.96, MAE ~0.81

## Configuration

### Model Parameters
```python
# Collaborative Filtering
min_business_reviews = 5  # Minimum reviews per business
min_user_reviews = 3      # Minimum reviews per user
similarity_method = 'cosine'  # 'cosine' or 'pearson'

# Content-Based Filtering
max_features = 1000       # TF-IDF feature limit
ngram_range = (1, 2)      # N-gram range for text analysis

# Context-Aware Filtering
context_weights = {
    'temporal': 0.3,
    'user_activity': 0.2,
    'business_popularity': 0.3,
    'base_rating': 0.2
}
```

## Algorithm Details

### Collaborative Filtering Implementation
- **User-User CF**: Finds users with similar rating patterns
- **Item-Item CF**: Identifies restaurants with similar user preferences
- **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation
- **Prediction**: Weighted average of similar users/items

### Content-Based Approach
- **Text Processing**: TF-IDF vectorization of reviews
- **Profile Generation**: User and business preference profiles
- **Matching**: Cosine similarity between profiles
- **Feature Engineering**: N-gram analysis and keyword extraction

### Context-Aware Features
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based rating patterns
- **User Context**: Activity level and consistency metrics
- **Business Context**: Popularity and rating stability
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adaptive importance scoring

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Efficiency
- Sparse matrix operations for large datasets
- Batch processing for similarity computations
- Efficient data structures for real-time predictions

### Scalability Considerations
- Modular design for easy algorithm swapping
- Configurable parameters for different dataset sizes
- Optimized similarity calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Errors with Large Datasets**
```python
# Reduce dataset size or use sampling
processed_data = processed_data.sample(n=10000)
```

**Poor Recommendation Quality**
- Check data quality and preprocessing steps
- Adjust filtering thresholds for users/businesses
- Tune algorithm parameters

**Slow Performance**
- Reduce similarity matrix dimensions
- Use approximate algorithms for large datasets
- Implement caching for frequent computations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Deep learning integration (Neural Collaborative Filtering)
- Real-time streaming recommendations
- A/B testing framework for algorithm comparison
- Advanced context features (location, weather, events)
- Multi-criteria recommendation support

### Research Directions
- Graph-based recommendation algorithms
- Explainable AI for recommendation transparency
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving recommendations
- Multi-modal content analysis (images, audio)
